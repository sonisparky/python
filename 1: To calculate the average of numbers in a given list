'''EXPLANATION:

1: Enter the number of elements to be inserted in the list
2: The value of i ranges from 0 and it is incremented when the body of the loop is executed
3: Now input the elements which is get stored in variable elem
4: a.append(elem) which is used to append the elements to the list
5: Now the value of i will be incremented to 2
6: sum(a) is used to sum the elements
7: Average is calculated by sum of elements divided by total number of elements
8: The print statement is used to output the average, round(avg,2) is used to round the decimal point upto 2'''
