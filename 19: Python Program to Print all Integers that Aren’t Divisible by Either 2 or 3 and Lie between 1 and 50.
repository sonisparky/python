'''ALGORITHM:
    
1.	Use a for-loop ranging from 0 to 51.
2.	Then use an if statement to check if the number isn’t divisible by both 2 and 3.
3.	Print the numbers satisfying the condition.
4.	Exit.'''

#SOURCE CODE:

for i in range(0,51):
    if(i%2!=0&i%3!=0):
        print(i)
        
'''EXPLANATION:
    
1.	The for loop ranges from 0 to 50 (as 51 isn’t exclusive).
2.	The expression within the if-statement checks if the remainder obtained when the number divided by 2 and 3 is one or not.
3.	If the remainder isn’t equal to 0, the number isn’t divisible by either 2 and 3.
4.	The number satisfying the condition is printed.'''
