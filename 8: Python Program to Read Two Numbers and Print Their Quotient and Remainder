'''ALGORITHM:
    
1.	Enter the first and second number and store it in separate variables.
2.	Then obtain the quotient using division and the remainder using modulus operator.
3.	Exit.'''

#SOURCE CODE:

a=int(input("Enter the first number: "))
b=int(input("Enter the second number: "))
quotient=a//b     #Dividing the two numbers to get the quotient
remainder=a%b     #dividing to get the remainder
print("Quotient is:",quotient)
print("Remainder is:",remainder)

'''EXPLANATION:

1.	User must enter the first and second number .
2.	The quotient is obtained using true division (// operator).
3.	The modulus operator gives the remainder when a is divided by b.'''
