'''ALGORITHM:
    
1.	Enter the upper range limit and the lower range limit and store it in separate variables.
2.	Use a for-loop ranging from the lower range to the upper range limit.
3.	Then use an if statement if check whether the number is odd or not and print the number.
4.	Exit.'''

#SOURCE CODE:

lower=int(input("Enter the lower limit for the range:"))
upper=int(input("Enter the upper limit for the range:"))
for i in range(lower,upper+1):
    if(i%2!=0):      #the remainder is checked if it is equal to 0 it is not printed or it is printed
        print(i)
        
'''EXPLANATION:
    
1.	User must enter the upper range limit and the lower range limit.
2.	The for loop ranges from the lower range limit to the upper range limit.
3.	The expression within the if-statement checks if the remainder obtained when the number divided by 2 is one or not (using the % operator).
4.	If the remainder isnâ€™t equal to 0, the number is odd and hence the number is printed.'''
