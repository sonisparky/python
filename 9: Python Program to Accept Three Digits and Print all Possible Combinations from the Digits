'''ALGORITHM:
    
1.	Enter the first, second and third number and store it in separate variables.
2.	Then append all the three numbers to the list.
3.	Use three for loops and print the digits in the list if none of their indexes are equal to each other.
4.	Exit.'''

#SOURCE CODE:

a=int(input("Enter first number:"))
b=int(input("Enter second number:"))
c=int(input("Enter third number:"))
d=[]     
d.append(a)   #uploading the value of a to d
d.append(b)   #uploading the value of b to d
d.append(c)   #uploading the value of c to d
for i in range(0,3):
    for j in range(0,3):
        for k in range(0,3):
            if(i!=j&j!=k&k!=i):
                print(d[i],d[j],d[k])
                
'''EXPLANATION:

1.	User must enter the first, second and third number.
2.	All the elements are appending into a list for the ease of comparison.
3.	The for loops range from 0-2 which are basically the indexes of the three elements in the list.
4.	If none of the indexes are equal to each other, the element associated with the particular element in the list is printed.'''
