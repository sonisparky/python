'''ALGORITHM:
    
1.	Take a value from the user and store it in a variable n.
2.	Use a for loop where the value of i ranges between the values of n-1 and 0 with a decrement of 1 with each iteration.
3.	Multiply empty spaces with n-i and ‘*’ with i and print both of them.
4.	Exit.'''

#SOURCE CODE:

n=int(input("Enter number of rows: "))
for i in range (n,0,-1):
    print((n-i) * ' ' + i * '*')
    
'''EXPLANATION:
    
1.	User must first enter the value and store it in a variable n.
2.	The for loop enables i to range between n-1 and 0 with a decrement of 1 with each iteration.
3.	For each iteration, ” ” is multiplied with n-i and ‘*’ is multiplied with i to ensure correct spacing of the stars.
4.	The required pattern is printed.'''
