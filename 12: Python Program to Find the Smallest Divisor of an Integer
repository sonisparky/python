'''ALGORITHM:
    
1.	Take in an integer from the user.
2.	Use a for loop where the value of i ranges from 2 to the integer.
3.	If the number is divisible by i, the value of i is appended to the list.
4.	The list is then sorted and the smallest element is printed.
5.	Exit.'''

#SOURCE CODE:

n=int(input("Enter an integer:"))
a=[]
for i in range(2,n+1):   #the i ranges from 2 to n+1
    if(n%i==0):
        a.append(i)    #the smallest divisor will be inserted to a
a.sort()
print("Smallest divisor is:",a[0])

'''EXPLANATION:
    
1.	Enter an integer
2.	The for loop ranges from 2 to the number
3.	If the remainder of the number divided by the value of i is 0 that means that the element is a divisor of the number
4.	The divisor of the number is then appended to the list
5.	The list is then sorted and the smallest element which is the element with index 0 is printed'''
