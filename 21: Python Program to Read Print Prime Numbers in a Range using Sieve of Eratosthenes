'''ALGORITHM:
    
1. Take the value of n from the user.
2. Initialise the sieve with numbers from 2 to n.
3. Use a while loop with the condition that the sieve is not empty
4. Get the smallest number that is prime
5. Remove that number and it’s multiples
6. Continue till the sieve is empty
7. Exit'''

#SOURCE CODE:

n=int(input("Enter upper limit of range: "))
sieve=set(range(2,n+1))
while sieve:
    prime=min(sieve)
    print(prime,end="\t")
    sieve-=set(range(prime,n+1,prime))
 
print()

'''EXPLANATION:
    
1.	User must first enter the value for upper limit of range and store it in a variable n.
2.	The sieve is initialised to a set which ranges from 2 to n( as n+1 is not included).
3.	The while loop is used to ensure that the sieve isn’t empty.
4.	The variable prime is initialised with the least number in the sieve and the prime number is printed.
5.	The sieve is then removed with all multiples of the prime number.
6.	Steps 4 and 5 continue till value of sieve becomes empty.'''
