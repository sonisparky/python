'''ALGORITHM:
    
1.	Take a value from the user and store it in a variable n.
2.	Use a for loop where the value of i ranges between the values of 1 and n.
3.	Print the value of i and ‘+’ operator while appending the value of i to a list.
4.	Then find the sum of elements in the list.
5.	Print ‘=’ followed by the total sum.
6.	Exit.'''

#SOURCE CODE:
n=input("Enter a number: ")
a=[]
for i in range(1,n+1):
    print(i,sep=" ",end=" ")
    if(i<n):
        print("+",sep=" ",end=" ")
    a.append(i)
print("=",sum(a))
 
print()

'''EXPLANATION:
    
1.	User must first enter the value and store it in a variable n.
2.	The for loop enables i to range between 1 and n (as n+1 is not included).
3.	For each iteration, the value of i is printed.
4.	‘+’ operator is printed only if i'''
