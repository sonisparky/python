ALGORITHM:

1.	Take the values of both the elements from the user.
2.	Store the values in separate variables.
3.	Add both the variables and store it in the first variable.
4.	Subtract the second variable from the first and store it in the second variable.
5.	Then, subtract the first variable from the second variable and store it in the first variable.
6.	Print the swapped values.
7.	Exit.

a = int(input("Enter the first variable:"))
b = int(input("Enter the second variable:"))

a = a+b   #the current value of a and b are added
b = a-b   #the new value of a is used to subtract
a = a-b   #the new vale of a and b is used 

print("a is:",a,"b is:",b)

EXPLANATION:

1.	First enter the values for both the elements.
2.	The first element is assigned the sum of the first two elements.
3.	Second element is assigned the difference between the sum in the first variable and the second variable, which is basically the first element.
4.	Later the first element is assigned the difference between the sum in the variable and the second variable, which is the second element.
5.	The swapped values are printed in the output.
