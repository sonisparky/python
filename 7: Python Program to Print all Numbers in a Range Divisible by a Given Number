'''ALGORITHM:
1.	Take in the upper range and lower range limit from the user.
2.	Take in the number to be divided by from the user.
3.	Using a for loop, print all the factors which is divisible by the number.
4.	Exit.'''

#SOURCE CODE:

lower=int(input("Enter lower range limit:"))
upper=int(input("Enter upper range limit:"))
n=int(input("Enter the number to be divided by:"))
for i in range(lower,upper+1):
    if(i%n==0):
        print(i)
        
'''EXPLANATION:
1.	Enter the upper range limit and the lower range limit.
2.	Then Enter the number to be divided from the user.
3.	The value of i ranges from the lower limit to the upper limit.
4.	Whenever the remainder of the number divided by i is equal to 0, i is printed.'''
