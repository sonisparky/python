'''ALGORITHM:

1.	Take a value from the user and store it in a variable n.
2.	Use two for loop where the value of j ranges between the values of 1 and n and value of i ranges between 1 and j.
3.	Print the value of i and ‘+’ operator while appending the value of i to a list.
4.	Then find the sum of elements in the list.
5.	Print ‘=’ followed by the total sum.
6.	Exit.'''
    
#SOURCE CODE:
    
n=int(input("Enter a number: "))
for j in range(1,n+1):
    a=[]
    for i in range(1,j+1):
        print(i,sep=" ",end=" ")
        if(i<j):
            print("+",sep=" ",end=" ")
        a.append(i)
    print("=",sum(a))
 
print()

'''EXPLANATION:
    
1.	User must first enter the value and store it in a variable n.
2.	The outer for loop enables j to range between 1 and n (as n+1 is not included) while the inner for loop enables i to range between 1 and i.
3.	For each iteration, the value of i is printed.
4.	‘+’ operator is printed only if i'''
