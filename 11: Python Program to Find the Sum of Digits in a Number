'''ALOGOTITHM:

1.	Take the value of the integer and store in a variable.
2.	Using a while loop, get each digit of the number and add the digits to a variable.
3.	Print the sum of the digits of the number.
4.	Exit.'''

#SOURCE CODE:

n=int(input("Enter the numbers:"))
sum = 0
while n>0 :
    dig=n%10   #the last digit is taken ie;the remainder
    sum=sum+dig
    n = n//10    #the first digits except the last is taken ie; the quotient
print("the total sum of digits is:",sum)

'''EXPLANATION:

1.	Enter the value and store it in a variable.
2.	The while loop is used and the last digit of the number is obtained by using the modulus operator.
3.	The digit is added to another variable each time the loop is executed.
4.	This loop terminates when the value of the number is 0.
5.	The total sum of the number is then printed.'''
