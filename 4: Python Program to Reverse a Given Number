'''ALGORITHM:

1.	Enter the value of the integer and store in a variable.
2.	Using a while loop, get each digit of the number and store the reversed number in another variable.
3.	Print the reverse of the number.
4.	Exit.'''

#SOURCe code:

n=int(input("Enter number: "))  #Enter the number to get reversed
rev=0
while(n>0):
    dig=n%10      #the remainder is taken as dig
    rev=rev*10+dig
    n=n//10       #the quotient is taken
print("Reverse of the number:",rev)

'''EXPLANATION:

1.	User must first enter the value and store it in a variable n.
2.	The while loop is used and the last digit of the number is obtained by using the modulus operator.
3.	The last digit is then stored at the one’s place, second last at the ten’s place and so on.
4.	The last digit is then removed by truly dividing the number with 10.
5.	This loop terminates when the value of the number is 0.
6.	The reverse of the number is then printed.'''
