'''ALGORITHM:

1.	Enter the value of a element and store in a variable n.
2.	Convert the integer into string and store it in another variable.
3.	Add the string twice so the string gets concatenated and store it in another variable.
4.	Then add the string thrice and assign the value to the third variable.
5.	Convert the strings in the second and third variables into integers.
6.	Add the values in all the integers.
7.	Print the total value of the expression.
8.	Exit.'''

#SOURCE CODE:

n=int(input("Enter a number n: "))
temp=str(n)            #The integer is converted to string
t1=temp+temp           #the string is not added just concatenated
t2=temp+temp+temp      #concatenation is done
comp=n+int(t1)+int(t2)           #here addition process is carried out
print("The value is:",comp)      #the added value is printed


'''PROGRAM EXPLANATION:

1.	Enter the value and store it in a variable n.
2.	The integer is converted to string for concatenation of the value of n.
3.	The string is then concatenated once and twice and stored in separate variables.
4.	To find the total sum, the string is converted back to integer.
5.	The total value of the expression is then printed.'''
