'''ALGORITHM:
    
1.	Take a value from the user and store it in a variable n.
2.	Use two for loop where the value of j ranges between the values of 0 and n-1 and value of i also ranges between 0 and n-1.
3.	Print the value of 1 when i is equal to j and 0 otherwise.
4.	Exit.'''

#SOURCE CODE:
    
n=int(input("Enter a number: "))
for i in range(0,n):
    for j in range(0,n):
        if(i==j):
            print("1",sep=" ",end=" ")
        else:
            print("0",sep=" ",end=" ")
    print()
    
'''EXPLANATION:
    
1.	User must first enter the value and store it in a variable n.
2.	The outer for loop enables j to range between 1 and n-1 (as n is not included) while the inner 
for loop also enables i to range between 1 and n-1.
3.	For each iteration, the value of 1 is printed if i is equal to j and value of 0 is printed otherwise.
4.	The sep and end parameters of the print function help in formatting and print() allows values to 
printed in a new line for each iteration of the outer for loop.'''
